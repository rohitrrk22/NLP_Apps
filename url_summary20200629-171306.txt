 In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Neural networks can be applied to the problem of intelligent control (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning ("fire together, wire together"), GMDH or competitive learning. Musk also funds companies developing artificial intelligence such as DeepMind and Vicarious to "just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence. Many of the problems in this article may also require general intelligence, if machines are to solve the problems as well as people do. IBM has created its own artificial intelligence computer, the IBM Watson, which has beaten human intelligence (at some levels). "robotics" or "machine learning"), the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences. A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.
