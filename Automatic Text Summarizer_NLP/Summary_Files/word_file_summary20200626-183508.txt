While there are many ways to skin the cat of the AI landscape, hopefully below provides a useful explanatory framework?—?a value chain of sorts. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are in a heavyweight fight investing over $20 billion in AI in 2016. Will it just be the brave, the few and the large?

The companies noted are representative of larger players in each category but in no way is this list intended to be comprehensive or predictive.
